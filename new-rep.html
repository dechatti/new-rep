     <h1>My Favourite Anime Characters</h1>
     <h3>By the way i like a ton of anime Characters, but here's a few</h3>

     <H2>SAITAMA; From one punch man</H2>
     <img src="https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=Saitama&FORM=IQFRBA&id=ECB22611A467F46A99F9A0A3D008273F7BA2A48E">
     <p>As for me he is the strongest in this series. He works as an hero and he destroys his foes with just one punch and at a point
         in time he felt tired of working because he couldn't get a worthy opponent who could take one of his punches.</p>
         <p>Watch Saitama:</p> <iframe src="https://youtu.be/Mwp7lKobbig"></iframe> 
     
     <H2>NARUTO; From Naruto Shippuden</H2>
     <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.8vMkZhtmriEwbOORtCHhxAAAAA?pid=ImgDet&rs=1">
     <p>The number one most hyperactive ninja in the Konoha village also known as the nine-tailed beast host.
        His life long dream was to become the Hokage of his village(That's the strongest person in the whole village)
        which was later achieved at the end of the series(unfortunately).I learned a lot from this series and that's partially why i like this character.
         </p>
       <p>Watch Naruto:</p> <iframe src="https://youtu.be/Na9-j1n75DQ"></iframe>

       <H2>DORORO; From Dororo</H2>
       <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.45eeb7e1f5f02f2a7353268f05a2615e?rik=vIgkR5d4Hp5yTg&pid=ImgRaw&r=0">
       <p>This one is filled with adventures and family feud drama of a young man, i like it because of the determination and show of resolve in this 
           particular series. It is filled with bloodshed tho, so beware </p>
         <p>Watch Dororo:</p> <iframe src="https://youtu.be/CZGGEAJSyhE"></iframe>

         <H2>JIN; From Samurai champloo</H2>
       <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.20fe78dba6527db7c5e59f654bf96408?rik=Fc%2bR62TM%2b0Zh%2bQ&pid=ImgRaw&r=0">
       <p>Living in the world of samurai, this series is about this wayward nigger that does things his way, he later meets his 
           match; someone he can't seem to beat in swordfight, it humored me and i like the adventures too.</p>
         <p>Watch Dororo:</p> <iframe src="https://youtu.be/LbG5STFZ3C0"></iframe>

         <H2>TANJIRO; From Demon Slayer</H2>
         <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.5b9bd18200c8324eff1d740d7c7526d6?rik=5y0RxVULbhm02Q&pid=ImgRaw&r=0">
         <p> Like Dororo this is also about demons, the adventure is very nice. The graphics is just one of the best, it makes it more 
             enjoyable while watching. I think the plot is very good too and the swordfighting techniques here are more different from 
            the others i've watched.Still enjoying it. </p>
