     <h1>My Favourite Anime Characters</h1>
     <h3>By the way i like a ton of anime Characters, but here's a few</h3>

     <H2>SAITAMA; From one punch man</H2>
     <img src="https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=Saitama&FORM=IQFRBA&id=ECB22611A467F46A99F9A0A3D008273F7BA2A48E">
     <p>As for me he is the strongest in this series. He works as an hero and he destroys his foes with just one punch and at a point
         in time he felt tired of working because he couldn't get a worthy opponent who could take one of his punches.</p>
         <p>Watch Saitama:</p> <iframe src="https://youtu.be/Mwp7lKobbig"></iframe> 
     
     <H2>NARUTO; From Naruto Shippuden</H2>
     <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.8vMkZhtmriEwbOORtCHhxAAAAA?pid=ImgDet&rs=1">
     <p>The number one most hyperactive ninja in the Konoha village also known as the nine-tailed beast host.
        His life long dream was to become the Hokage of his village(That's the strongest person in the whole village)
        which was later achieved at the end of the series(unfortunately).I learned a lot from this series and that's partially why i like this character.
